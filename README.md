# Android
I've commented the important portions of code but if you have any comments or questions feel free to ask.
The app should be designed with scalability in mind, and there are quite a few nonoptimal structures used,
so any feedback is appreciated!

I'm using basic version control semantics, with the first digit representing non-backwards-compatible/api changes, the second 
digit representing feature additions, and the third representing bug fixes and small patches.
